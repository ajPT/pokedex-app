# pokedex-app
This is one of the apps made in Udemy's iOS course "iOS 9 and Swift 2: From Beginner to Paid Professional". 
I want to do a little more than the requirements so I added a UIScrollView when showing the Pokemon Details.
This app covers the following fields:
* UICollectionView
* UIScrollView
* Web Requests & json parsing
* Usage of Alamofire (downloaded by CocoaPods)
