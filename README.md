# pokedex-app
This is one of the apps made in Udemy's iOS course "iOS 9 and Swift 2: From Beginner to Paid Professional". 
I want to do a little more than the requirements, so I added a UIScrollView when showing the Pokemon Details, added a loading screen, added more information about Pokemon and used Grand Central Dispatch to control the web request response.

This app covers the following fields:
* UICollectionView
* UISearchBar
* UIScrollView
* Web Requests (PokeAPI) & json parsing & GCD
* Usage of Alamofire (downloaded via CocoaPods)
